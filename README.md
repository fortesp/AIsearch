Contains a selection of the following algorithms:

- [Uniform Cost](https://algorithmicthoughts.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/artificial-intelligence-uniform-cost-searchucs/)
- [Depth First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
- [Breath First Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
- [A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm) (Breath First Search with a heuristic approach)
 
Example of problems to test:
- [Missionaires and Cannibals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missionaries_and_cannibals_problem)
- Nickel and Dime (To move a pair of coins from one side to another...)
- Buckets(i.e. Two buckets of water. One with 5 liters and another with 3. How do i measure 4 liters. I can only move, fill them up or empty them..)
- [Eight Puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle)
- Specific graph path problem (Graph represented by multi array of nodes. Find the best path to reach a specific node)
